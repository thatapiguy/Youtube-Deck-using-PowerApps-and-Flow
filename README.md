# Youtube-Deck-using-PowerApps-and-Flow

Import the PowerVideo zip file in PowerApps using Import Package option.

Upload the excel file in your OneDrive . 

Delete the exisiting "Channels" OneDrive datasource in the PowerApp and then add a new OneDrive datasource that connects to the 'Channels' table in the excel file.

That's it! Enjoy!
